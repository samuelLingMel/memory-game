# Memory Game

A basic program of the game memory game.
My first webdesign project but I followed a tutorial to comeplete.
Tasked to me by General Assembly for self learning via tutorial slides and videos.
Then improved with more game logic for a more functional game.

The most memorable moment was when I was trying to change a string to an integer by using a Integer() method but I didn't realise that in Javascript it is Number() because the dataype varies depending on the programming language. I only knew python at this point and didn't even know there was a difference until we went through datatypes in class and I had a lightning bolt moment realising my error.
