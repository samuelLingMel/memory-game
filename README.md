# Memory Game

A basic program of the memory game or "pairs". Shows a bit of information on the history of the game and then the cards which you can press and flip over. You score when you can flip two of the same number. 
This was my first webdesign project where I followed a tutorial provided by General Assembly to complete.
They provided slides for self learning then I improved on top of what was provided to get a more seamless game.

The most memorable moment was when I was trying to change a string to an integer by using a Integer() method but I didn't realise that in Javascript it is Number() because the dataype varies depending on the programming language. I only knew python at this point and didn't even know there was a difference until we went through datatypes in class and I had a lightning bolt moment realising my error.
